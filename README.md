# Dashou's Item Manager (DIM)
## A simple and effective item storage system
This is a small ComputerCraft: Tweaked projet I am working on. The goal is to make an effective item managing system using only this very mod.

### ⛏ Primary goals
|Status|Goal|
|-|-
|✔|Create an item database from an existing item storage.
|✔| Send items into the network through an input storage inventory.
|✔|Search (quickly !) for items in the network, including unique items (Potions, named items, etc..).
|✔| Extract items from the network to an output storage inventory.
|**WIP**|Find a nice way for the user to extract unique items.
|❌|See miscelleanous storage statistics.
|❌|Make a user-friendly interface.

### ⚙ Secondary goals
|Status|Goal|
|-|-
|❌|Create an account system, which keeps tracks of who has which items.
|❌|After a login, actions and disconnect, the history of insertions and extractions is kept.
|❌|The last actions can be printed on paper.

For balance reasons that I am the sole judge of, this is made to only work on wired networks.
