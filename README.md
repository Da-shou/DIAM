# Dashou's Item Manager (DIM)
## A simple and effective item storage system
This is a small ComputerCraft: Tweaked projet I am working on. The goal is to make an effective item managing system using only this very mod.

### How to use DIM ?
Simply download the latest release source code, put it on a computercraft disk (You will need a bigger disk size than the default).
Once that's done, insert the disk in a disk drive. From the computer connected to the drive, run the setup.lua program from within the disk.
Go through the setup program. If you have enough storage, DIM will be installed on your computer, your disk will automatically eject and you can start enjoying DIM !

### ⚙ Secondary goals
|Status|Goal|
|-|-
|❌|Create an account system, which keeps tracks of who has which items.
|❌|After a login, actions and disconnect, the history of insertions and extractions is kept.

For balance reasons that I am the sole judge of, this is made to only work on wired networks.
