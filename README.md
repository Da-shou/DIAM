# Dashou's Item Manager (DIM)
## A simple and effective item storage system
This is a small ComputerCraft: Tweaked projet I am working on. The goal is to make an effective item managing system using only this very mod.

### ⛏ Primary goals
- Create an item database from an existing item storage.
- Send items into the network through an input storage inventory.
- Search (quickly !) for items in the network.
- Extract items from the network to an output storage inventory.
- See miscelleanous storage statistics.
- Make a user-friendly interface.

### ⚙ Secondary goals
- Create an account system, which keeps tracks of who has which items.
- After a login, actions and disconnect, the history of insertions and extractions is kept.
- The last actions can be printed on paper.

For balance reasons that I am the sole judge of, this is made to only work on wired networks.
As an added bonus, I am challenging myself to online write this entire program on a basic computer, directly from the game.
